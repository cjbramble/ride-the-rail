# Cypress Skeleton

---

## Installation

Clone repository with SSH:

`git clone <replace>`

Switch to root of project:

`cd <replace>`

Install package:

`npm install`

Test install succeded:

`./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

---

## Configuration

In `cypress.json` the `baseUrl` is currently set to <replace>.

To override or use additional configurations create a separate `cypress.env.json`.

Example:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "<replace>"
}
```

## Usage

We use custom Scripts in `package.json` to open Cypress, run all tests, and some other things from the command line.

```json
"scripts": {
    "cy:open": "cypress open",
    "cy:run": "cypress run",
    "git:hook": "husky install",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
}
```

To open Cypress:

`npm run cy:open`

To run all tests:

`npm run cy:run`

---

## Formatter

We're going to let robots do some formatting for us. Enable the git hook for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) by using a couple of scripts from `package.json`.

`npm run git:hook`

Now every time you make a commit the formatter will run. If you wish to run the formatter prior to commit (recommended) then just use the format script.

`npm run format`
